# SCP: Project Unreal
 SCP: Project Unreal is an Unreal Engine recreation of the game SCP: Containment breach.


This is the open-source restart of development for SCP: Project Unreal.
The original version of this project was not set up with source control from the beginning and its codebase was too cluttered and lots of things had to be redone constantly which is why i decided to restart development from scratch.
